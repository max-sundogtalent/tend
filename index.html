      <h1>TendAI is the agentic layer for private capital</h1>
      <p>
        TendAI is the agentic layer for private capital that keeps track of the early seeds, nurtures the sprouts, and watches what's growing in your portfolio. Some startups sprout fast, others need time, and a few grow into the kind of trees you name parks after â€” generational companies that change everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        But without attention, even the best seedlings wither.
      </p>
      <p>
        TendAI works 24/7 as the connective tissue between your team and founders, spotting traction in your dealflow, surfacing follow-on opportunities, and ensuring your most promising investments get the sunlight and capital they need.
      </p>
      <p>
        TendAI helps you cultivate what's already planted â€” so nothing exceptional dies from neglect. Some startups scale fast. Others take time. A few become the kind of companies that leave a legacy. We make sure none are forgotten in the shuffle. If you're excited to work at the intersection of AI, venture, and founder experience â€” come grow with us.
